## Reflections

- Improved my understanding with state management both local(useState) and global(redux toolkit).
- Been using mostly Bootstrap but came to like Tailwind now and able to discover Flowbite for react for easier app design and theme.
- It was hard to manage forms but thankfully found Formik and Yup to validate the inputs and stop my tears in managing form state.
- Firebse realtime database is awesome for projects like this or maybe even bigger ones but needs to properly structure the data which I will look more closely next time.
